            I am a recent graduate of Harvard University, where I obtained my degree in chemistry in 2015. After graduation, I worked as a management consultant for DB&A, where I helped clients in various industries improve their business operations and strategies. In addition to my experience in consulting, I have always had an interest in technology and web development. As a result, I decided to pursue a career in the tech industry and am now a full-stack web developer.

            <br>
            Before entering the tech industry, I also worked as an installation manager for Empire Today, where I managed a team of installers and ensured that all of our projects were completed on time and to the highest standards. This experience gave me valuable leadership and project management skills that I now use in my work as a web developer.
            I am excited to continue learning and growing in the tech industry and to be a part of the dynamic and constantly evolving world of web development.
